# Hacker Rank - 3 months preparation kit

Hacker Rank code playground is slow and I don't really like, so, I decided to
work locally and execute my code with Deno which has built in TypeScript
support, and a great ecosystem that helps to unit test, format and bench code in
a really easy way.

## Project structure

Every statement is at `src/statements/` directory, each of them must have:

### Testing data bundle

> A basic template is autogenerated using the `new-statement` Deno task.

In order to test the statement functions, we need `input data` and a
`expected output`. This data **must** be in every statement directory. Should be
named `statement-name.data.json` and **must** satisfy the following TS type
`TestingDataBundle`.

```ts
type TestCaseData = {
	/**
	 * Contains space-separated values of the same type
	 */
	input: string;
	/**
	 * Expected output after executing the function with parsed `input` data
	 */
	output: string | string[] | number[];
};

type TestingDataBundle = {
	data: TestCaseData[];
};
```

- statement-name.md
  - Must contain the statement description.

- StatementName.test.ts
  - Must contain the all the tests to the generated function.

- StatementName.ts
  - This file must contain the function definition and all its types.

## How to add a new statement

Add a new statement to the project by running the following command:

```bash
deno task new-statement
```

The required data to generate the above described files will be prompted and all
of them will be added to the `src/statements/` directory

## How to test the code

Test the statements with
[Deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/installation) by
running the following command:

```bash
deno test src/StatementName.test.ts
```

or simply use the currently defined task `test`:

```bash
deno task test
```

This command watchs for changes in all statements directory
`src/statements/*/*.ts` TS files, and run all the existing tests.

## VSCode Deno extension

For better Developer Experience install the
[Deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/setup_your_environment#visual-studio-code)
extension for Visual Studio Code and run
`Deno: Initialize Workspace Configuration` command in the F1 window. I already
ship the `.vscode/settings.json` config file, so, is probably that this step is
not mandatory.
