# Mars Exploration

A space explorer's ship crashed on Mars! They send a series of SOS messages to Earth for help.

Letters in some of the SOS messages are altered by cosmic radiation during transmission. Given the
signal received by Earth as a string, `s` , determine how many letters of the SOS message have been
changed by radiation.

## Example

`s = SOSTOT`

The original message was `SOSSOS`. Two of the message's characters were changed in transit.
